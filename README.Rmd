# Notes from Chapter 12
### Step 12.1

- Samara's note: I already had all of the prerequisits met, so I was able to skip over this step

- Alyvia's note: I completed this step prior so all of the prerequisites are met.

- sravya's note: Already done

### Step 12.2
- Samara's note: Since a repo was already made for us, I did not have to go through these steps

- Alyvia's note: This repo was made for us.

- Sravya's note: Made Repo in previous class.

### Step 12.3
- Samara's note: I followed the steps to create a new project from version control. I used the default name for the repo, and saved it into a folder titled "Labs", everything worked as expected

- Alyvia's note: I followed this step and created the new project using the repo url provided.

- Sravya note: Created Project with no isuue. 

### Step 12.4
- Samara's note: I am considering my notes from the pervious steps as changes. Now I will commit with hopefully no issues.

- Alyvia's note: I have commited my prior notes for this step, and I will commit this note as well.

- Sravya's note: Only after saving the changes, i can use the commit command. And sent a commit message.

### Step 12.5
- Samara's note: Since I was the first to push, I was able to push without any issues.

- Sravya's note: unable to push after commiting the changes. Resolved it by saving the changes then kniting it into a html file and then used commands in terminal such as "git add .", "git rebase --continue" and :q to quit and resolve all the commits. then was able to use the pull and push command.

- Alyvia's note: I ran into an issue when attempting to push. This was fixed by fixing changes and using the terminal to "git add ." and "git status". I then knitted the file and the push went through successfully. 


### Step 12.6
- Samara's note: I was able to see my commit message and the updated code within the GitHub remote

- Sravya's note:

### Step 12.7
- Samara's note: Since we are skipping the clean up, I am making no notes.

- Sravya's note:
