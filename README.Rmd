# Notes from Chapter 12
### Step 12.1

- Samara's note: I already had all of the prerequisits met, so I was able to skip over this step

- Shiva's note: Met all the prerequisits.

- Sravya's note:already done

### Step 12.2
- Samara's note: Since a repo was already made for us, I did not have to go through these steps

- Shiva's note: Repository already created, mnoved on to next steps.

### Step 12.3
- Samara's note: I followed the steps to create a new project from version control. I used the default name for the repo, and saved it into a folder titled "Labs", everything worked as expected

- Shiva's note: Followed the steps and created a new project.

- Sravya note: Created Project with no isuue 

### Step 12.4
- Samara's note: I am considering my notes from the pervious steps as changes. Now I will commit with hopefully no issues.

- Shiva's note: Succesfully commited.

- Sravya: Only after saving the changes, i can use the commit command. And sent a commit message.

### Step 12.5
- Samara's note: Since I was the first to push, I was able to push without any issues.

- Shiva's note: Faced some problem pushing the changes, was not able to get the push/pull button.
                Had to use some git rebase commands to complete that task, and then was able to get                 the push/pull after kniting the Rmd file again.
### Step 12.6
- Samara's note: I was able to see my commit message and the updated code within the GitHub remote

- Shiva's note: 
### Step 12.7
- Samara's note: Since we are skipping the clean up, I am making no notes.
