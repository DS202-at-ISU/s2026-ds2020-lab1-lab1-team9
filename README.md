# Lab report \#1

Follow the instructions posted at
<https://ds202-at-isu.github.io/labs.html> for the lab assignment. The
work is meant to be finished during the lab time, but you have time
until Monday evening to polish things.

Include your answers in this document (Rmd file). Make sure that it
knits properly (into the md file). Upload both the Rmd and the md file
to your repository.

All submissions to the github repo will be automatically uploaded for
grading once the due date is passed. Submit a link to your repository on
Canvas (only one submission per team) to signal to the instructors that
you are done with your submission.

# Notes from Chapter 12

### Step 12.1

- Samara’s note: I already had all of the prerequisits met, so I was
  able to skip over this step
- 

-sravya’s note:already done

### Step 12.2

- Samara’s note: Since a repo was already made for us, I did not have to
  go through these steps

### Step 12.3

- Samara’s note: I followed the steps to create a new project from
  version control. I used the default name for the repo, and saved it
  into a folder titled “Labs”, everything worked as expected

- Sravya note: Created Project with no isuue

### Step 12.4

- Samara’s note: I am considering my notes from the pervious steps as
  changes. Now I will commit with hopefully no issues.

Sravya: Only after saving the changes, i can use the commit command. And
sent a commit message.

### Step 12.5

- Samara’s note: Since I was the first to push, I was able to push
  without any issues.

### Step 12.6

- Samara’s note: I was able to see my commit message and the updated
  code within the GitHub remote

### Step 12.7

- Samara’s note: Since we are skipping the clean up, I am making no
  notes.
